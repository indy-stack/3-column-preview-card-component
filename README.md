## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

During this challenge I just focused on practicing what I learned during the previous challenges with grid and flexbox. Planning it's getting better so development time is decreasing which is a good thing.

 Something that I learn or rather realized is that by using CSS preprocessors like SASS or LESS I'll have less repetitive code. This is also the case with developing UIs with React. I'm glad I was able to realize this, now I know it is time to explore those options.


### Continued development

I think that I should pay more attention to grid, I find it to be powerful and there are properties I still do not feel comfortable with.
